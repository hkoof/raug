`raug' is a utility for real niche applications. Normally you would use `su'
for anything `raug` can do.

The niche case where `raug' might be useful is when you want to use the
`pam_exec' PAM-module to execute a command as the user authenticating, e.g.

session optional pam_exec.so /usr/sbin/raug -U PAM_USER /path/to/myscript

In this case you could also use `su' in the script where needed, but then
you would be able to use this in su's own PAM-stack as this would create 
a recursive mess. In this case `raug' comes to the rescue, and the script
you would want to execute becomes a little simpler as a bonus.
